    <h1>I'm Bringin' Git Streak Back... </h1>
    <p>So... you miss the git streak, huh? That side of you that feels it can only be adequately expressed through statistics (and if you are a programmer, that's probably a BIG side) wants to know, exactly how productive, in <span>actual numbers</span> you've been recently... </p>
    <p>And of course, how much <span>more</span> productive that is than Jake over on the web team. In, you know, actual numbers. Because that's meaningful. And, you know, also very useful from a productivity point of view as well, because you are in no way in some kind of personal competition-bordering-on-vendetta with Jake. At all.</p>
